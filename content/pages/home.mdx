## DKAN v2 is here!

We’ve paid close attention to how you gather, share, and use data in the real world, and we’ve kept your favorite DKAN features while plotting out some new ones.

Meanwhile, on the back end, we’ve totally rethought how an open source open data system should be built, and DKAN v2 is a Drupal 8-based, microservice-architected, schema-centered, API-first, front-end decoupled, open data platform. That means it’s more flexible, nimble, forward-thinking, and interoperable than ever before. Learn more about it [here](https://medium.com/dkan-blog/dkan-v2-is-here-aee0acf69c1e?sk=7c407a961d5c46e307a7c777c3f9f3ac)!

## _A full-featured Open Data portal, right out of the box_

_[U.S. Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/) calls DKAN a **“ready-to-use”** tool **“that will help agencies jump-start their open efforts”** and a **“real, implementable”** solution **“developed to significantly reduce the barrier to implementing open data at your agency.”**_
