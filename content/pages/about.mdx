By working together, we can bring our unique skills, experience, and perspective to use data in ways none of us could have envisioned alone. Open data reveals a world of possibility, and DKAN is here to help us make the most of it.
- ### Inclusiveness and Accessibility
Open data allows users from all walks of life to learn about and contribute to their communities. Academic researchers, policymakers, journalists and everyday citizens alike can all access and benefit from standardized, readily-accessible, machine-readable data. DKAN will always be free, easy-to-use for data publishers and data consumers, provide multilingual support, and will always strive to meet the needs of those with disabilities to ensure DKAN is accessible to all.

Opening data is just the first step, after that it is all about what we do with it. There are many amazing tools out there, and DKAN should be able to help you work with any tool you need.
