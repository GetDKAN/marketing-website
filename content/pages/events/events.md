## About


The 2019 DKAN Summit brings together the Drupal open data community to share, collaborate, and learn about using DKAN to support their open source open data efforts. We'll discuss what's new in DKAN, open data, and what's in store the future. We'll also work together to develop ideas for improvements to the platform, share what community members are working on, and discuss how to get involved in contributing to the project. You'll make lots of great connections to other members of the open source open data community, learn best practices, and contribute toward creating a better platform for everyone.
